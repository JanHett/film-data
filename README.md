# Film Data

This repository contains data about various types of films as well as tools for generating this data (e.g. by scraping it from manufacturer-provided data sheets).

Here's what's available so far:

| Film / Data | [Spectral Sensitivity](./spectral_sensitivity_curves/spectral_sensitivity_curves.ipynb) |

| Kodak Portra 400 | ✅ |
| Kodak Portra 890 | ✅ |

| Kodak Ultra Max 400 | ✅ |

While I have taken care to introduce as little error as the source allowed, these data may or may not be accurate. Use with caution.
